function [sttCode] = stateCode(sttAbbrev)
%STATECODE Returs the numerical code for the
%	specified input state.
%	[sttCode] = stateCode(sttAbbrev)
%		outputs the integer code for the state
%       in sttAbbrev.
%
%   INPUT
%   sttAbbrev is a string with the state abbreviation
%       as defined in [1].
%
%   OUTPUT
%   sttCode is a scalar value with the numerical
