function [X] = events2signal(Events)
%EVENTS2SIGNAL Takes the event matrix Events and converts it to signal form.
%  This function undoes
%   the operation performed by signal2events.
%   [X] = events2signal(Events) returns the information
%       of array Events into signal form (vector).
%
%   INPUT
%   Events is an N-by-3 vector with the information of
%       each event in X. Each row has the following
%       format: [Start Sample, End Sample, Type].
%
%   OUTPUT
%   X is an M-by-1 vector with a quantized signal (in
%       several categories).
%
%   EXAMPLE
%   [X]=events2signal(Events);
