function [Events] = signal2events(X)
%SIGNAL2EVENTS Takes a signal X and separates it into different events according to the quantization.
%	This function undoes the operation performed by  events2signal.
%   [Events] = signal2events(X) returns the information
%       of signal X into event structure form.
%
%   INPUT
%   X is an M-by-1 vector with a quantized signal (in
%       several categories).
%
%   OUTPUT
%   Events is an N-by-3 matrix with the information of
%       each event in X. Each row has the following
%       format: [Start Time, End Time, Type].
%
%   EXAMPLE
%   [Events]=signal2events(X);
%
%   VERSION HISTORY

%   2013_12_16 - Updated help header based on [1] (CARR).
